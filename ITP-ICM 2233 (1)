Write a blog post about how computation applies to your interests, due 24 hours before the next class. This could be a subject you've studied, a job you've worked, a personal hobby, or a cause you care about. What projects do you imagine making this term? What projects do you love?(You can review and contribute to the ICM Inspiration Wiki page). In the same post (or a new one), document the process of creating your sketch. What pitfalls did you run into? What could you not figure out how to do? How was the experience of using the web editor? Did you post any issues to github?

POST: 
I've been pondering the blurred lines between creative content and computer programming for some time now. Specifically, it appears that the capabilities and potential of computers far surpass those of humans. This raises the question: is there a point in competing with computers? Do we still require human creators in the field of design? It seems that, given the relentless advancement of technology, there may be no way for humans to outperform computers. This uncertainty prompted me to explore various job opportunities after graduating. I wanted to witness how computers were reshaping the world, observe how people were adapting to these new technologies, and seek a balance between human ingenuity and technology. This is the primary reason I chose to join ITP â€“ to understand how these dynamics work and how to use this power intelligently.

I have a profound interest in game design because it combines creativity and computation greatly. When individuals play games, they experience a positive emotion because they actually enjoy the entertainment provided by computers. So, I'm thrilled to embark on a project that combines my passion for game design with an exploration of multimedia. My plan is to create a game inspired by the classic "Gluttonous Snake" (or Snake), but with an innovative twist. I aim to craft something that doesn't require deep thinking but is purely for the sheer enjoyment of it.

When I began working on my sketch, one of the most significant challenges I encountered was understanding the importance of order. The sequencing in coding is not the same to the layering concept in software like Photoshop. In coding, to change the color of something, you don't place it beneath the object; instead, you position it above. This was the first time I truly grasped the concept of "straightforward" in coding. It demands mental clarity and organization before diving into the actual coding process.

Moreover, struggling to find the right positioning was a considerable hurdle. It felt like solving a puzzle game where I needed to remember the exact x and y coordinates and ensure they were accurate. To tackle this issue, I opted to break down each component, noting down the numbers I would need.

The web-based editor I used proved to be a great tool for me, because it reignits my passion for coding. I had a previous coding experience during my undergraduate studies, but it was a frustrating endeavor. I had downloaded a load of software programs, only to find myself lost within them, unsure of how to operate or even exit them. The web editor, on the other hand, is a brilliantly designed tool, especially for individuals like me, who want to explore coding with ease and fun. It eliminates the hassles associated with software installations and offers an intuitive platform to people like me.
